Here is the text:\n\ng it took much time and skill. Hieroglyphic script was used for writing on temple walls and in tombs. A highly simplified version of hieroglyphics, known as hieratic script, came into being. It used the same princi-ples as hieroglyphic writing, but the drawings were sim-plified by using dashes, strokes, and curves to represent them. Hieratic script was used for business transactions, record keeping, and the general needs of daily life.Egyptian hieroglyphs were at first carved in stone. Later, hieratic script was written on papyrus, a paper made from the papyrus reed that grew along the Nile. Most of the ancient Egyptian literature that has come down to us was written on rolls of papyrus.The Egyptian scribes were masters of the art of writing and also its teachers. At the age of 10, boys of the upper classes went to schools run by scribes. Training to be a scribe took many years. Students learned to read and write by copying texts. Discipline was strict, as is evident from the following Egyptian saying: \u201cA boy\u2019s ears are on his back. He listens only when he is beaten.\u201d Girls remained at home and learned housekeeping skills from their mothers.Art and SciencePyramids, temples, and other monuments bear witness to the architectural and artistic achievements of the ancient Egyptians. Artists and sculptors were expected to follow particular formulas in style. This gave Egyptian art a dis-tinctive look for many thousands of years. For example, the human body was often portrayed as a combination of profile, semi-profile, and frontal view to accurately repre-sent each part.Egyptians also made advances in mathematics. Mathe-matics helped them in building their massive monuments. Egyptians were able to calculate area and volume and used geometry to survey flooded land.The Egyptians developed an accurate 365-day calendar by basing their year not only on the movements of the moon, but also the bright star Sirius. Sirius rises in the sky just before the annual flooding of the Nile River, providing a standard date from which to calculate.The practice of embalming (preserving a dead body to protect it from decay) led to medical expertise in human anatomy. Archaeologists have recovered directions from doctors for using splints, bandages, and compresses for treating fractures, wounds, and disease. Other ancient civ-ilizations acquired medical knowledge from the Egyptians. /uni2713Reading Check Describing What was distinctive about Egyptian art?Vocabulary1.

The Egyptians believed the god Osiris judged the dead and that those who led a good life would enjoy an eternity of the most pleasant activities they enjoyed on earth.\nBURIAL OF WEALTHY EGYPTIANSThe tombs of many wealthy Egyptians were low, rectangular mud-brick and stone buildings called mastabas. These wealthy Egyptians would spend years, or even decades, planning and preparing their own tombs. They would choose a site (as close to the pharaoh\u2019s as possible), arrange for workmen to prepare the tomb, and hire artisans and artists to stock it with the items they needed and wanted in the afterlife.\n44Wealthy Egyptians mummified their dead to preserve the bodies for the afterlife.\nAncient writings state that the mummification process took 70 days.\nCanopic jars were used to hold the organs of the deceased after they were removed during the mummification process.Most Egyptians were buried with personal items and food. Pharaohs were buried with extravagant items, like this chariot from the tomb of Tutankhamen.\nStatues of the deceased called ka statues were placed in the tomb. Egyptians believed that the ka, or life force, of the deceased would inhabit the statue.\nThis ka statue is a depiction of Khafre, who ruled from 2558 B.C. to 2532 B.C. BURIAL OF PEASANTSThe majority of Egyptians could not afford the elaborate funerals of the upper class. Most\u2014including farmworkers and laborers\u2014were merely wrapped in cloth and placed in individual or communal graves. The afterlife was of great importance to Egyptians at all levels of soci-ety, so relatives might leave some food or simple objects with them. That way, the dead would be comforted by familiar things.\nANALYZING VISUALS\n1. Making Inferences How was the class struc-ture of ancient Egyptian society reflected in its funerary practices?2.

After about 1200 B.C., there was no dominant power in the region. The Phoenicians emerged as the most important trading kingdom in the Mediterranean area. The Israelites did not create an empire, but they left a world religion, Judaism, that influenced the later religions of Christianity and Islam.The Role of Nomadic Peoples  Nomadic peoples, especially the Indo-Europeans, served an impor-tant function for civilized societies by spreading goods and new technology.HISTORY & YOU Why are residents of a community sometimes suspicious of or hostile to strangers? Learn how civilizations related to nomads.Our story of civilization so far has focused on Mesopotamia and Egypt. Recent evidence suggests that another civilization flour-ished in central Asia (in what are now the republics of Turkmeni-stan and Uzbekistan) around 4,000 years ago. These people built mud-brick buildings, raised sheep and goats, had bronze tools, and used irrigation to grow wheat and barley. Recently discovered inscriptions show that these early people may have had writing.On the fringes of these civilizations lived nomadic peoples who depended on hunting and gathering, herding, and sometimes farming for their survival. Most important were the pastoral nomads who on occasion overran settled communities and then created t h e i r  o w n  e m p i r e s .  P a s t o r a l  n o m a d s  domesticated a n i -mals for food and clothing. They followed regular migratory routes to provide food for their animals.People who lived in settled communities often viewed nomads as hostile and barbaric. The groups did interact, however. Nomads traded animals and animal products for grains and vegetables they were unable to grow. Pastoral nomads also carried products between civilized centers. In this way nomads often passed on new technology, such as the use of bronze and iron, that helped strengthen civilizations. When overpopulation or drought dis-rupted the pastoral nomads\u2019 normal patterns, however, they often attacked the civilized communities to obtain relief.The Indo-Europeans were one of the most important nomadic peoples. The term Indo-European r e f e r s  t o  a  p a r t i c u l a r  g r o u p  o f  people who spoke a language derived from a single parent tongue. Indo-European languages include Greek, Latin, Persian, Sanskrit, and the Germanic languages.

Around 2000 /b.sc./c.sc. they began to move into Europe, India, and western Asia. One group moved into Asia Minor and Anato-lia around 1750 /b.sc./c.sc. With the native peo-ples, they formed the Hittite kingdom with its capital at Hattushash (Bogazk\u00f6y in modern Turkey).Between 1600 /b.sc./c.sc. and 1200 /b.sc./c.sc., the Hittites created an empire in western Asia and threatened the power of the Egyp-tians. The Hittites were the first Indo-Europeans to use iron. Iron made stronger weapons, which were also cheaper as iron ore was abundant. New invaders, the \u201cSea Peoples,\u201d destroyed the Hittite Empire.The end of the Hittite kingdom and the weakening of Egypt around 1200 /b.sc./c.sc.temporarily left no dominant powers in western Asia. As a result, several small kingdoms and city-states emerged, nota-bly around Syria and Palestine. The Phoe-nicians were one of these peoples. /uni2713Reading Check Identifying Who were the first Indo-Europeans to use iron?\n1. Location Which cities were located in the Hittite heartland? 2.

Learn about the Phoenician alphabet.The Phoenicians lived in the area of Pal-estine along the Mediterranean coast on a narrow band of land 120 miles (193 km) long. After the downfall of the Hittites and the Egyptians, the newfound political independence of the Phoenicians helped them expand their trade. Trade had long been the basis of their prosperity. The chief cities of Phoenicia\u2014Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon\u2014were ports on the eastern Mediter-ranean. The Phoenicians produced a num-ber of goods for foreign markets, including purple dye, glass, and lumber from the cedar forests of Lebanon.The Phoenicians built ships and became great international sea traders. They eventually created a trade empire. The Phoenicians charted new routes not only in the Mediterranean but also in the Atlan-tic Ocean, where they reached Britain and sailed south along the west coast of Africa. They set up a number of colonies in the western Mediterranean. Carthage, on the North African coast, was their most famous colony.Phoenician culture is best known for its alphabet. The Phoenicians, who spoke a Semitic language, simplified their writing by using 22 different signs to represent the sounds of their speech. These 22 charac-ters, or letters, could be used to spell out all the words in the Phoenician language. Although the Phoenicians were not the only people to invent an alphabet, theirs was important because it was eventually passed on to the Greeks. From the Greek alphabet came the Roman alphabet that we still use today. /uni2713Reading Check Identifying What was the most significant cultural invention of the Phoenicians?\n1.

Read to learn about the interaction between religions in the eastern Mediterranean.To the south of the Phoenicians lived another group of Semitic-speaking people known as the Israelites. They were a minor factor in the politics of the region. How-ever, their religion\u2014known today as Juda-ism\u2014flourished and later influenced the religions of Christianity and Islam. Much of the Israelites\u2019 history and reli-gious beliefs was eventually written down in the Hebrew Bible, which is known to Christians as the Old Testament. Accord-ing to Israelite traditions, they are descen-dants of the patriarch Abraham. Their ancestors migrated from Mesopotamia to Canaan. Their lifestyle was based on graz-ing animals rather than on farming. Then, because of drought, the Israelites moved to Egypt, where they were enslaved until Moses led them out of Egypt. They wan-dered for many years in the desert until they returned to Canaan. Some interpretations of recent archaeo-logical evidence contradict the details of the biblical account. It is generally agreed, how-ever, that between 1200 /b.sc./c.sc. and 1000 /b.sc./c.sc., the Israelites organized in tribes and estab-lished a united kingdom known as Israel. The United KingdomBy the time of King Solomon, who ruled from about 970 /b.sc./c.sc. to 930 /b.sc./c.sc., the Israel-ites had established control over all the land that came to be called Israel and made Jerusalem i n t o  i t s  c a p i t a l .  S o l o m o n  expanded the government and army of ancient Israel, and also encouraged trade. Solomon is best known for building a tem-ple in the city of Jerusalem. The Israelites viewed the temple as the symbolic center of their religion and of the Israelite king-dom itself. Under King Solomon, ancient Israel reached the height of its power.King Solomon was also known for his wisdom. Once, two women brought a child before him, each claiming that she was the child\u2019s mother. Solomon ordered his servant to cut the child in half, giving one half to each woman. The first woman objected: \u201cPlease, my lord, give her the living baby! Don\u2019t kill him!\u201d The second woman replied, \u201cNeither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!\u201d Then Solomon said: \u201cGive the baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother.\u201d Accord-ing to the biblical account, \u201cWhen all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to adminis-ter justice.\u201dThe Divided KingdomAfter Solomon\u2019s death, tension among the tribes within Israel led to the creation of two separate kingdoms. The Kingdom of Israel was composed of the ten north-ern tribes and had its capital at Samaria. To the south, the Kingdom of Judah con-sisted of two tribes and had its capital at Jerusalem.In 722 or 721 /b.sc./c.sc., the Assyrians overran the Kingdom of Israel and sent many Isra-elites to other parts of the Assyrian Empire. Most of these scattered Israelites (the \u201cten lost tribes\u201d) merged with neighboring peo-ples and gradually lost their identity.The Kingdom of Judah managed to retain its independence for a while, but a new enemy soon appeared on the horizon. The Chaldeans (kal\u2022DEE\u2022uhnz) defeated Assyria, conquered the Kingdom of Judah, and completely destroyed Jerusalem in 586 /b.sc./c.sc. Many people of Judah were sent as captives to Babylonia. Only the poorest remained. The words of Psalm 137 evoke the memory of their exile:PRIMARY SOURCE\u201cBy the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept when we remembered Zion. . . . How can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a foreign land? If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.\u201d\u2014Psalms 137: 1, 4\u20136\nCHAPTER 2 Western Asia and Egypt49\u0019\u0012\u0003\u0012\u0011\u0011\u0006\u0003\u0019\u000b\u0011\t\u0019\u0012\u0005\u0000\u001fThe Babylonian captivity did not last. New conquerors, the Persians, allowed the people of Judah to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their city and temple. The revived province of Judah was controlled by Persia until the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 300s /b.sc./c.sc. The people of Judah sur-vived, eventually becoming known as the Jews and giving their name to Judaism.JudaismThe Jews were monotheistic; t h e y  believed in one God called Yahweh (YAH\u2022/w.sc/a.sc/y.sc), the Creator of the world and everything in it. In the Jews\u2019 view, God ruled the world; all peoples were his ser-vants, whether they knew it or not. God had created nature but was not in nature. The sun, the wind, and other natural phe-nomena were not gods, but God\u2019s creations to be admired but not worshiped.This powerful creator was not removed from the life he had created. God was just and good, and he expected goodness from his people. If they did not obey his will, they would be punished. However, he was also \u201ccompassionate, slow to anger, and rich in love.\u201d Each person could have a personal relationship with this being.The covenant, law, and prophets were three aspects of the Jewish religious tradi-tion. The Jews believed that during the exodus from Egypt, when Moses led his people out of bondage, God made a cove-nant, or contract, with them. Yahweh promised to guide them if they obeyed the laws of God as expressed most promi-nently in the Ten Commandments. Accord-ing to the Bible, Yahweh gave these laws to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Jews believed God sent certain religious teachers, or prophets, to serve as his voice to his people. When the Jews were forced by the Romans to leave Palestine in a.d. 70, they began nearly 1,900 years without a homeland. As they settled throughout the world, many Jews assimilated into the cultures of their new communities by following local customs and speaking the local language. Still, they maintained their religious beliefs and customs, even though it often resulted in persecution. Eventually many Jews settled in the United States. Their impact, like many who have settled in America, has helped shape our national culture. Today more Jews live in the United States than in Israel. For nearly 2,000 years, Jews have maintained their customs despite being scattered across the world. The Jewish people retained their heritage through perseverance and rigorous study of ancient Hebrew texts.\u2022\u2022\n1. Explaining What effect did the Romans have upon Judaism? 2.

The prophets declared that faithlessness to God would bring catastrophe, but that turning from evil would bring God\u2019s mercy. The prophets introduced concepts that enriched the Jewish tradition. Later prophets embraced a concern for all humanity. All nations would come to the God of Israel and find peace. PRIMARY SOURCE\u201cThey will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.\u201d \u2014Isaiah 2:4The prophets also cried out against social injustice. They condemned the rich for causing the poor to suffer. They denounced luxuries, and they threatened Israel with prophecies of dire punishments for these sins. They said that God\u2019s command was to live justly, share with others, and care for the poor and the unfortunate. These words became a source for ideals of social justice.The following selection makes clear the prophets\u2019 belief that unjust actions would bring God\u2019s punishment.PRIMARY SOURCE\u201cThe Lord enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: \u2018It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses. What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?\u2019 . . . Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle. The gates of Zion will lament and mourn. . . . \u2019\u201d \u2014Isaiah 3:14\u201317, 24\u201326The religion of Israel was unique among the religions of western Asia and Egypt. The biggest difference was its belief in only one God (monotheism). In other ancient reli-gions, only priests (and some rulers) had access to the gods. In the Jewish tradition, God\u2019s wishes, though communi-cated to the people through prophets, had been written down. No leader of Israel could claim that he alone knew God\u2019s will. This knowledge was available to anyone who could read the Hebrew Bible.Although the prophets developed a concern for all humanity, the demands of Judaism\u2014the need to obey God\u2014encouraged a separation between Jews and their non-Jewish neighbors. Unlike most other peoples of South-west Asia, Jews would not accept the gods of their con-querors or neighbors and could consequently not be integrated into another community. /uni2713Reading Check Identifying Which aspect of Israelite culture had the greatest impact on Western civilization?Vocabulary1.

Location Why did Phoenician traders create trade networks going west rather than east?2. Movement Examine the map of Phoenicia and its colonies. How did trade and colonization contribute to the spread of the Phoenician writing system?\nA Phoenician Lake Spread along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, Phoenicia was a collection of independent city-states. Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos were major port cities. The Phoenicians were a sea-going people skilled at both navigation and trade. Powered by oars and sails, their ships traveled west-ward across the Mediterranean. By around 900 B.C., Phoenician merchants and traders had set up exten-sive Mediterranean trade routes. Some ships went far-ther, traveling to ports in Britain, Spain, and along the west coast of Africa.Colonies and Trade Goods In time Phoenicians established merchant colonies near their trade routes on the southern coast of Spain (Iberia), western coast of Sicily, and northern coast of Africa. Carthage became one of Phoenicia\u2019s largest and most important colo-nies. Unlike many other colonies in the ancient world, these settlements were not founded in response to overcrowding at home or desire for empire. Interest in trade led to settlement. Colonies served as trading posts and as places to dock and resupply ships. Most were located along coasts, on offshore islands, or pen-insulas with easy access to the sea.Phoenician ships carried a variety of goods includ-ing timber, glass, tin, silver, ivory carvings, and metal work. Phoenicia\u2019s best known luxury export was cloth colored with a dye known as Tyrian purple that came from the Murex sea snail. Only the rich could afford this costly purple cloth.Spreading Culture The most lasting contribution of the Phoenicians was not their skills as sailors or trad-ers, but the writing system they used as they crossed the Mediterranean. As the Phoenicians built up trade networks, their writing system spread. The Greeks adopted and modified the Phoenician alphabet. Centuries later the Romans carried this alphabet throughout their empire.

The Assyrians were better at conquest than at ruling, and their empire lasted less than one hundred years. The Persian Empire brought many years of peace to Southwest Asia, increasing trade and the general well-being of its people.The Assyrian Empire  The Assyrians ruled with harsh tactics that brought about the fall of their empire.HISTORY & YOU Why do you think a country that is good at fighting might not be as good at ruling? Read how the Assyrians built and lost an empire. The first of the new empires was formed in Assyria, located on the upper Tigris River. The Assyrians w e r e  a  S e m i t i c - s p e a k i n g  people who exploited the use of iron weapons to establish an empire by 700 /b.sc./c.sc. The Assyrian Empire included Mesopotamia, parts of the Plateau of Iran, sections of Asia Minor, Syria, Pales-tine, and Egypt down to Thebes. In less than a hundred years, however, internal strife and resentment of Assyrian rule began to tear the Assyrian Empire apart. In 612 /b.sc./c.sc., the empire fell to a coalition of Chaldeans and Medes (people who lived in the east), and it was divided between those powers.At its height, the Assyrian Empire was ruled by kings whose power was seen as absolute. Under their leadership, the Assyrian Empire became well organized. Local officials were directly responsible to the king. The Assyrians also developed an efficient system of communication to administer their empire. A network of posts was established throughout the empire that used relays of horses to carry messages. The system was so effective that a governor anywhere in the empire could send a question and receive an answer from the king within a week. One of the last Assyrian kings, Ashurbanipal, established one of the world\u2019s first libraries at Nineveh. This library has provided abundant informa-tion concerning ancient Southwest Asian civilizations.The Assyrians were good at conquering others. Through many years of practice they developed effective military leaders and fighters. The Assyrian army was large, well organized, and disci-plined. A force of infantrymen was its core, joined by cavalrymen and horse-drawn war chariots that were used as platforms for shooting arrows. Moreover, the Assyrians had the first large armies equipped with iron weapons.\nThe Rise of New Empires\n54Panel of Ashurbanipal, c. 650 B.C.\nAnother factor in the army\u2019s success was its ability to use different military tactics. The Assyrians could wage guerrilla war-fare in the mountains, set battles on open ground, and lay siege to cities. They used battering rams and siege towers to ham-mer at the city\u2019s walls. Then they would tunnel under them, making them collapse.The Assyrians used terror as an instru-ment of warfare. They regularly laid waste to the land in which they were fighting. They smashed dams; looted and destroyed towns; set crops on fire; and cut down trees, particularly fruit trees. The Assyrians were especially known for committing atrocities on their captives. King Ashurba-nipal recorded this account of his treat-ment of prisoners: PRIMARY SOURCE\u201c3,000 of their combat troops I felled with weapons. . . . Many I took alive; from some of these I cut off their hands to the wrist, from others I cut off their noses, ears, and fingers; I put out the eyes of many of the soldiers. . . . I burned their young men and women to death.\u201d\u2014H.W.F . Saggs, The Might That Was Assyria /uni2713Reading Check Summarizing Why were the Assyrians so successful at conquering others? 1.

He rebuilt Babylon as the center of his empire and gave it a reputation as one of the great cities of the ancient world, but Babylon fell to the Persians in 539 /b.sc./c.sc.The Rise of the Persian EmpireThe Persians were Indo-Europeans who lived in what is today southwestern Iran. Primarily nomadic, the Persians were eventually unified by one family. One member of this family, Cyrus, c r e a t e d  a  powerful Persian state that stretched from Asia Minor to India. Cyrus ruled from 559 /b.sc./c.sc. to 530 /b.sc./c.sc. In 539 /b.sc./c.sc., he captured Bab-ylon. His treatment of Babylonia showed remarkable restraint and wisdom. He also allowed the Jews who had been held there as captives to return to Israel.The people of his time called Cyrus \u201cthe Great.\u201d He demonstrated wisdom and compassion in the conquest and organiza-tion of his empire. Unlike the Assyrian rul-ers, Cyrus had a reputation for mercy. Medes, Babylonians, and Jews all accepted him as their ruler. Cyrus had a genuine respect for other civilizations. For example, he used Assyrian, Babylonian, and Egyp-tian designs for building his palaces.Cyrus\u2019s successors sought to extend the territory of the Persian Empire. His son Cambyses (kam\u2022BY\u2022/s.sc/e.sc/e.sc/z.sc) successfully invaded Egypt. Darius, who ruled from 521 /b.sc./c.sc. to 486 /b.sc./c.sc., added a new Persian province in \n1.

He then conquered Thrace in Europe, creat-ing the world\u2019s largest empire to that time. Contact with Greece led Darius to invade the Greek mainland.Darius strengthened the Persian government. He divided the empire into 20 provinces, called satrapies(SAY\u2022truh\u2022pees). A governor, or satrap, literally a \u201cpro-tector of the kingdom\u201d, ruled each province. Each satrap collected taxes, provided justice, and recruited soldiers.An efficient communication system sustained the Per-sian Empire. Officials easily traveled through the empire on well-maintained roads dotted with way stations that provided food, shelter, and fresh horses. The Royal Road stretched from Lydia to Susa, the empire\u2019s chief capital.In this system, the Persian king\u2014the \u201cGreat King\u201d\u2014held an exalted position. He had the power of life and death.Much of the empire\u2019s power depended on the military. By the time of Darius, Persian kings had created a stand-ing army of professional soldiers from all over the empire. At its core were a cavalry force and an elite infantry force. They were known as the Immortals because whenever a member was killed, he was immediately replaced. The Fall of the Persian EmpireAfter Darius, the Persian kings became isolated at their courts, surrounded by luxuries. As the kings increased taxes, loyalty to the empire declined. Struggles over the throne weakened the monarchy (rule by a king or queen).Persian kings had many wives and children. The sons had little real power and many engaged in plots to gain the throne. This bloody struggle for the throne weakened the empire and led to its conquest by the Greek ruler Alex-ander the Great during the 330s /b.sc./c.sc.Persian ReligionZoroastrianism (/z.sc/o.sc/h.sc/r.sc\u2022uh\u2022WAS\u2022tree\u2022uh\u2022/n.sc/i.sc/h.sc\u2022zuhm), the Persians\u2019 religion, was their most original cultural con-tribution.

His teachings were recorded in the Zend Avesta, the sacred book of Zoroastrianism.Like the Jews, Zoroastrians were monotheistic. To Zoro-aster, Ahuramazda (the \u201cWise Lord\u201d) was a supreme god who created all things. Ahuramazda was supreme, but he was not unopposed. At the beginning of the world, the evil spirit Ahriman opposed him. Humans played a role in the struggle between good and evil. Ahuramazda gave humans the freedom to choose between right and wrong. The good person chooses the way of Ahuramazda, who would eventually triumph. /uni2713Reading Check Examining What caused the Persian Empire to decline after the death of Darius?Vocabulary1.

The ancient peoples of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Israel formulated different stories about the creation of the world. The various accounts, however, contain several similarities. What do creation stories reveal about ancient religious beliefs? Religion played a central role in the lives of ancient peoples. Creation stories describe the gods they worshipped and help explain how ancient societies interpreted the world around them.Creation accounts provide insights into the cultures of the people who developed them. Read the excerpts and study the painting to find out what the Babylonians, Hebrews, and Egyptians believed about the creation of the world. SOURCE 1The Babylonian story of creation is part of an epic poem titled En\u00fbma elish. The lord [Marduk1] trod upon the hinder part of Ti\u00e2mat2,And with his unsparing club he split her skull. . . .He split her open like a mussel into two parts;Half of her he set in place and formed the sky therewith as a roof. . . .He fixed the crossbar and posted guards;He commanded them not to let her waters escape. . . .The lord measured the dimensions of the Aps\u00fb3,And a great structure, its counterpart, he established, namely, Esharra4,The great structure Esharra which he made as a canopy. . . .As Marduk hears the words of the gods,His heart prompts him to create ingenious things.He conveys his idea to Ea5,Imparting the plan which he had conceived in his heart:\u201cBlood will I form and cause bone to be;Then will I set up lull\u00fb6, \u2018Man\u2019 shall be his name!Yes, I will create lull\u00fb: Man!Upon him shall the services of the gods be imposed that they may be at rest.\u201d\n1 Marduk: ruler of the gods in Babylonian mythology2 Ti\u00e2mat: monster goddess; the earliest salt waterSOURCE 2The book of Genesis contains an account of the Hebrew story of creation.34In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. . . .And God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light \u201cday,\u201d and the darkness he called \u201cnight.\u201d And there was evening and there was morning\u2014the first day.And God said, \u201cLet there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\u201d So God made the expanse and sepa-rated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. God called the expanse \u201csky.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the second day.And God said, \u201cLet the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\u201d And it was so. God called the dry ground \u201cland,\u201d and the gathered waters he called \u201cseas.\u201d And God saw that it was good. . . .Then God said, \u201cLet us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 3 Aps\u00fb: husband of Ti\u00e2mat; the earliest freshwater4 Esharra: a poetic name for the Earth58CHAPTER 2 Western Asia and Egypt The sun god, Re, makes his night journey in this drawing and relief from the tomb of Horemheb in Egypt, c. 1300 B.C.\n1.

Synthesizing How would you describe the beliefs that ancient societies held about the cre-ation of the world?\nSOURCE 3The ancient Egyptians had several creation myths. In one account, Re, the sun god, emerged from an egg that appeared on the surface of the ocean. Re later produced gods of air, earth, and heaven. Afterward, Re made humans and all other beings and objects on Earth. In the above painting, Re, the ram-headed figure, crosses through the underworld in his boat, carrying the spirits of Egyptians who have died. When Re reappears above the horizon at the beginning of each new day, the souls of the dead are reborn into new lives with him. Egyptians spent every day surrounded by symbols of their religion. They saw gods in the natural world, they had gods important to their hometowns, and they believed in gods of trade, justice, and prosperity. They expected the gods to care for them in the afterlife. 5 6 5 Ea: god of wisdom and magic; father of Marduk6 lull\u00fb: humansCHAPTER 2 Western Asia and Egypt59 Werner Forman/akg-imagesVisual Summary\n You can study anywhere, anytime by downloading quizzes and flash cards to your PDA from glencoe.com.\nAccounting Tablet, MesopotamiaANCIENT INNOVATIONS\u2022 The Mesopotamians established a collection of laws, along with inventingthe arch, dome, wheel, and a system of writing.\u2022 The Phoenicians invented the alphabet.\u2022 The Persians created the concept of astanding army.Tomb at Saqqara, EgyptANCIENT ENVIRONMENTS\u2022 The Egyptians received fertile soil from the floodwaters of the Nile for farming.\u2022 The Phoenicians set up a trading empire and colonies on the Mediterranean.\u2022 The Mesopotamians created irrigation and flood control systems.\nANCIENT RELIGIONS\u2022 The Mesopotamians and the Egyptians, who bothwere polytheistic, believed their rulers derivedtheir power from the gods.\u2022 The Israelites were monotheistic and believed God communicated through prophets.\u2022 The Persians followed Zoroastrianism, amonotheistic religion.Temple at Uruk, Mesopotamia\nThe ancient Sumerian city of Uruk was one of the first cities in the world.Egyptian farmers drive cattle across a river.\nSumerians used cuneiform to keep accounts, like this tablet account of donkeys harnessed for ploughing.\n60CHAPTER 2 Western Asia and Egypt(t)  Art Archive/Dagli Orti, (c)  Jane Sweeney/Lonely Planet Images, (b)  Art Archive/Mus\u00e9e du Louvre Paris/Dagli OrtiAssessmentTEST-TAKING TIP\nNeed Extra Help?If You Missed Questions . . .Go to Page . . .GO ONSTANDARDIZED TEST PRACTICEWhen a question asks for an answer related to a specific topic, such as geography, eliminate any choices that do not mention anything about that topic.
